        <h1>Volunteer for the Labour Party</h1>
        <p>
            We're glad you're interested in getting involved with the Labour Party in your area.
            Whether you're a member or just interested in helping out, we use this website to organise
            our campaign events and activists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Click <strong>Start</strong> to tell us who are are and what you can do, and we'll be in touch. Before that
            though, here are some things you should be aware of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    This website is independent from the Labour Party, but it's run by committed and experienced Labour
                    Party members.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    We'll store your information and we'll pass it on to members of the Labour Party who'll use it
                    to let you know about events and campaigns.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If you ask us to, we'll send you an automated email every so often with news and information about
                    events in your area.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    We may also pass on the information you provide to the Labour party to help with their candidate
                    selections
                    and to help find supporters to sign candidates' nomination forms.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The main purpose of this website is to track attendance at events, let people know what events are
            happening,
            and monitor how much campaigning is being done.
