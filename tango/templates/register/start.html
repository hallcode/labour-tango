            <h1>Volunteer for the Labour Party</h1>
            <p>
                We're glad you're interested in getting involved with the Labour Party in your area.
                Whether you're a member already or just interested in helping out, thank you.

                This can take up as much or as little time as you want. We normally deliver leaflets,
                knock on doors, or talk to people at events like a street stall.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should expect it to take up roughly <strong>3 hours a fortnight</strong>.

                    This website is independent from the Labour Party, but it's run by committed and experienced Labour
                    Party members.

                    We'll store your information and we'll pass it on to members of the Labour Party who'll use it
                    to let you know about events and campaigns.
                </li>
                <li class="m-1">
                    We may also pass on the information you provide to the Labour party to help with their candidate
                    selections and to help find supporters to sign candidates' nomination forms.

                The main purpose of this website is to track attendance at events, let people know what events are
                happening, and monitor how much campaigning is being done.
